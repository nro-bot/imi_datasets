\begin{abstract}
  Massage businesses in the illicit massage industry (IMIs) offer commercial sexual
  services. They can be found in all major cities in the United States. Due to
  increasing law enforcement and public scrutiny, as well as the potential for
  labor and sex trafficking of workers, a better understanding
  of the IMI is urgently needed. In this paper, we present two novel natural
  language (and spatiotemporal) datasets for the IMI, including the first ground
  truth location dataset. Specifically, we present a dataset consisting of
  \var{NUM_FORUM_POSTS} posts and metadata on \var{NUM_FORUM_USERS} users
  publicly available on a forum
  for buyers of commercial
  sex in IMIs. We also present legal documents, including extracted
  text, from over 6,000 administrative actions in Florida and Wisconsin. 
  We present several case studies showing the utility of these datasets: acronym
  expansion, related domain discovery, user demographic studies, change in 
  law enforcement interactions over time, and the range of fines and
  penalties actually given. These use cases are relevant not only to IMI
  researchers but also to the wider counter-trafficking and social sciences
  research communities. Our datasets represent a major step toward 
  applying advances in natural language processing to study the IMI in the
  pursuit of a more just society.

% In this section we first provide domain-specific background for our work, then
% explain our motivation and specify our research aims.

% \subsection{Domain-Specific Background}

% We provide a brief overview of the illicit massage industry (IMI), its
% importance, and how it relates to human trafficking. For the latter, we briefly
% compare and contrast a few different perspectives and leave detailed
% discussion to the supplementary materials. 

% \subsubsection{Illicit Massage Industry}

% This paper applies machine learning as a tool to study
% the illicit massage industry. An illicit massage business (IMB) is a business
% that may provide legitimate massages but derives revenue from commercial sex
% services.  These businesses operate in plain sight and can be found throughout
% the United States. IMBs form a large industry, and 2018 there were over 11,000
% IMBs in the United States (according to Polaris \cite{polaris-social}, a
% non-profit that works to end human trafficking in the US). Polaris estimated a
% combined annual revenue for IMBs of \$2.5 billion in 2018 alone. At the city and
% state levels, researchers have combined website data and in-person foot traffic
% estimate annual gross revenue. These estimates include over 100 million dollars
% in Houston, over 180 million in Dallas, and over 40 million in Georgia
% \cite{boucheEstimatingDemandIllicit2018}
% \cite{DallasweismannmelissaEstimatingDemandGross2019}
% \cite{rodgersbobStreetGraceIllicit2020} \footnote{These revenues include payment
% for massage services, not just illicit services.} According to a report by
% Polaris, the most common type of individuals are women in their thirties to
% fifties, who have children, arrived recently in from China or Korea, and speak
% very little English.

% This industry has come to prominence over time with the scandal involving
% billionaire Robert Kraft \cite{narratives} as well as the the 2020 mass shooting targeting
% employees at Asian massage parlors in Atlanta \cite{lam_double-edged_2021}.
